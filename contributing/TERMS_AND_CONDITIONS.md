Contributing to ReactTogether: Terms and Conditions
================================================

**Important**: submitting any contributions to the ReactTogether project implies your **full acceptance of these terms**,
including the *"ReactTogether Individual Contributor License Agreement"* detailed at the end. 

Who can contribute?
-------------------

Anyone, with the unique condition that they must be a **private individual**, acting in 
his/her own name, and not being endorsed in their contributed work by any company or government.

Note that this condition will not only refer to the ownership of the effort invested in contributing 
to the project, but also to the fact that no private or public company will be mentioned as a a part 
of your contribution on the project's website or code, including but not limited to web/email addresses 
or package names.


How will your relation with the ReactTogether project be?
-----------------------------------------------------

Your contributions will have the form of GitHub *pull requests*. Note that contributors do not 
have read+write (or *pull+push*) access to the project repositories, only project *members* do. 

Also, please understand that *not all pull requests will be accepted and merged into the project's 
repositories*. Talking about your planned contributions with the project members before creating pull requests
will maximize the possibilities of your contributions being accepted.

About the code you contribute
-----------------------------

### General guidelines:
  
  - Obviously, **your code must both compile and work correctly**. Also, the addition of any new patches to the 
    codebase should not render it unstable in any way.
  - All your code should be easy to read and understand by a human.
  - There should be no compilation warnings at all.
  - Checkstyle must pass without errors or warnings. Run `npm run lint` to check your code.

### Detailed code quality standards:
  
  - All your code should compile and run in **Node 16.x or higher**.
  - All comments, names of classes and variables, log messages, etc. must be **in English**.

  

About the documentation/articles you contribute
-----------------------------------------------

Note the following only applies to documentation/articles meant to be published at the ReactTogether website.

  - All documentation artifacts, including articles, must be written **in correct English**.
  - Topic and text structure must be first discussed and agreed upon with the project members.
  - Project members may edit and make small changes to your texts --of which you will be informed-- before 
    publishing them.
  - Format and visual styles must adhere to the ReactTogether website standards, of which you will be informed
    by the project members.



Pay special attention to this
-----------------------------

All ReactTogether software is distributed under the **Apache 2.0** open source license, and your contributions
will be licensed in the same way.

If you work for a company which, by the way or place in which your code was written, by your contract terms 
or by the laws in your country, could claim any rights (including but not limited to intellectual or industrial 
property) over your contributed code, you will have to send the project members (either by email from your 
authorised superiors or by signed fax), a statement indicating that your company agrees with the terms 
explained in this page, and that it both authorises your contribution to ReactTogether and states that will 
never claim any kind of rights over it.

        license the Contribution which you would have had without entering into the agreement.
    (b) To the maximum extent permitted by the relevant law, you grant to ReactTogether a perpetual, worldwide,
        non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license under the copyright covering the
        Contribution, with the right to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to

to assert such moral rights against ReactTogether or its successors in interest, or any of our licensees, either 
direct or indirect.

    (b) You own the Copyright and patent claims covering the Contribution which are required to grant
        the rights under Section 2.
    (c) The grant of rights under Section 2 does not violate any grant of rights which you have made to

### 4. Disclaimer

EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN SECTION 3, THE CONTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED "AS IS". MORE PARTICULARLY,

### 6. Miscellaneous

    6.1 This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Spain excluding its
        conflicts of law provisions. Under certain circumstances, the governing law in this section might be
        superseded by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods ("UN
        Convention") and the parties intend to avoid the application of the UN Convention to this Agreement
        and, thus, exclude the application of the UN Convention in its entirety to this Agreement.
    6.2 This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between you and ReactTogether for your Contributions to
        ReactTogether and overrides all other agreements or understandings.
    6.3 If You or ReactTogether assign the rights or obligations received through this Agreement to a third party, 
        as a condition of the assignment, that third party must agree in writing to abide by all the rights and
        obligations in the Agreement.
    6.4 The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of this
        Agreement in one situation shall not affect the right of a party to require such performance at any time
        in the future. A waiver of performance under a provision in one situation shall not be considered a
        waiver of the performance of the provision in the future or a waiver of the provision in its entirety.
    6.5 If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be
        replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original
        provision and which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply
        notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the
        maximum extent possible under law.
