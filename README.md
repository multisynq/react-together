React Together provides a series of hooks that synchronize state across multiple clients.
This allows to build any component you want, such as real-time chat, live cursors and polls, multiplayer games, etc.
It also provides a series of pre-built components to help you get started.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install react-together
```

## üî® Usage

The snippet below shows you how easy it is to create a synchronized counter.

```tsx
import { useStateTogether } from 'react-together'

export function SynchronizedCounter() {
  const [value, setValue] = useStateTogether('counter', false)

  return <button onClick={() => setValue((p) => p + 1)}>{value}</button>
}
```
