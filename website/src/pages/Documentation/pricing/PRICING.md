## React Together Pricing

### Free and Open Source

The React Together framework is free and open source, and we're committed to keeping it that way. Always. The synced network traffic itself does have a cost, but is much cheaper than alternatives and free in many use cases.

### Powered by Multisynq

The network traffic for these "_togetherified_" components leverages the cutting-edge Multisynq Synchronizer DePIN infrastructure. It's like a glimpse into the future of web development! Multisynq has simple, low cost pricing and free development resources. Often, <mark>ninety percent cheaper</mark> than the alternatives.

Prices and latency are low because anyone can [run a Synchronizer](https://multisynq.io), sharing their Internet bandwidth and getting paid by adding to the network. This network architecture is genius and scalable, fulfilling some of the earliest lofty goals of a decentralized, distributed, edge-first, infrastructure and it costs much less than AWS or GCP. Plus, you can run your own synchronizers and **be paid for handling traffic**!

### Generous Free Tier

Many developers can enjoy our monthly free tier indefinitely. Build, experiment, and grow without worrying about costs.

### Cost-Effective Scaling

For those with high-traffic applications, our clever Synchronizer technology often results in lower costs compared to traditional solutions. How? Synchronizers have a few tricks up our sleeve:

1.  **Deterministic Magic**: Thanks to the innovative tech from Croquet & Multisynq, a significant portion of what would normally be network traffic never leaves your userâ€™s device.
2.  **On-Device Processing**: Rough estimates suggest that about 1/3 of the typical traffic becomes "on-device, on-silicon traffic." This means it's processed locally, never touching the network.
3.  **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Rather than paying for expensive servers in the cloud, we use local Synchronizers that leverage (arbitrage) Synchronizer host available bandwidth at much lower costs.

### Migration from Croquet to DePin

React Together is built using Croquet React, an open-source framework that runs on the current Croquet Legacy Network. React Together will transition seamlessly to the Multisynq DePin Network.
