## React Together Pricing

### Free and Open Source

The React Together framework is free and open source, and we're committed to keeping it that way. Always. The synced network traffic itself does have a cost, but is much cheaper than alternatives and free in many use cases.

### Constant Innovation

Our passionate developers at Croquet and Multisynq are constantly cooking up awesome new components for React Together. Why? Because it's fun, and we love what we do!

### Community Collaboration

We thrive on community contributions! Whether you want to submit pull requests directly to our repo or create your own package that depends on react-together, we're excited to see what you'll build. Your creativity fuels our ecosystem!

### Powered by Multisynq

The network traffic for these "togetherified" components leverages the cutting-edge Multisynq Synchronizer DePIN infrastructure. It's like a glimpse into the future of web development! Multisynq has simple, low cost pricing and free development resources. Often, ninety percent cheaper than the alternatives.

### Generous Free Tier

Many developers can enjoy our monthly free tier indefinitely. Build, experiment, and grow without worrying about costs.

### Cost-Effective Scaling

For those with high-traffic applications, our clever Synchronizer technology often results in lower costs compared to traditional solutions. How? Synchronizers have a few tricks up our sleeve:

1.  Deterministic Magic: Thanks to the innovative tech from Croquet & Multisynq, a significant portion of what would normally be network traffic never leaves your userâ€™s device.
2.  On-Device Processing: Rough estimates suggest that about 1/3 of the typical traffic becomes "on-device, on-silicon traffic." This means it's processed locally, never touching the network.

### Earn money from React Together

Thatâ€™s right! Anyone can help synchronize applications by becoming a Synqer. Learn more in the Multisynq website
