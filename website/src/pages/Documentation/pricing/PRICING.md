## React Together Pricing

### Free and Open Source

The React Together framework is free and open source, and we're committed to keeping it that way. Always. The synced network traffic itself does have a cost, but is much cheaper than alternatives and free in many use cases.

### Constant Innovation

Our passionate developers at [Croquet](https://croquet.io) and [Multisynq](https://multisynq.io) are constantly cooking up awesome new components for React Together. Why? Because it's fun, and we love what we do!

### Community Collaboration

We thrive on community contributions! Whether you want to submit pull requests directly to our repo or create your own package that depends on `react-together`, we're excited to see what you'll build. Your creativity fuels our ecosystem!

### Powered by Multisynq

The network traffic for these "*togetherified*" components leverages the cutting-edge Multisynq Synchronizer DePIN infrastructure. It's like a glimpse into the future of web development! Multisynq has simple, low cost pricing and free development resources. Often, <mark> 90% cheaper than the alternatives. </mark>

Prices and latency are low because anyone can [run a Synchronizer](https://multisynq.io), sharing their Internet bandwidth and getting paid by adding to the network. This network architecture is genius and scalable, fulfilling some of the earliest lofty goals of a decentralized, distributed, edge-first, infrastructure and it costs much less than AWS or GCP. Plus, you can run your own synchronizers and **be paid for handling traffic**! 


### Generous Free Tier

Many developers can enjoy our monthly free tier indefinitely. Build, experiment, and grow without worrying about costs. And beginning in Q4 2024, free Developer Synchronizers will become available that will make development and testing free forever.

### Cost-Effective Scaling

For those with high-traffic applications, our clever Synchronizer technology often results in lower costs compared to traditional solutions. How? Synchronizers have a few tricks up our sleeve:

1.  **Deterministic Magic**: Thanks to the innovative tech from Croquet & Multisynq, a significant portion of what would normally be network traffic never leaves your userâ€™s device.
2.  **On-Device Processing**: Rough estimates suggest that about 1/3 of the typical traffic becomes "on-device, on-silicon traffic." This means it's processed locally, never touching the network.
