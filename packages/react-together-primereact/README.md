# React Together PrimeReact

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]

This library wraps a series of [PrimeReact](https://primereact.org/) components to make them synchronized across multiple clients.
All components maintain most of their original API, so you can use them as you would use the original components.

For more information about the wrapped components API, please refer to our [documentation](https://reacttogether.dev/primereact/Checkbox).

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
npm install react-together-primereact
```

## ðŸ”¨ Usage

```tsx
import { ColorPickerTogether } from 'react-together-primereact'

export function YourComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Color Picker</h1>
      <ColorPickerTogether rtKey="color-picker" />
    </div>
  )
}
```
